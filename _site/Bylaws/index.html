<dl>
<dt>Section 1</dt>

<dd>The Senate shall, by a majority vote for recognition and a 2/3 vote for chartering,have the discretionary power to charter/recognize (hereinafter referred to as &#8220;accredit&#8221;) two types of Union Organizations:</dd>
</dl>

<ol>
<li>Chartered Organizations</li>

<li>Recognized Organizations</li>

<li>Chartered and Recognized Organizations shall be collectively known as Union Accredited Organizations (UAO).</li>
</ol>

<dl>
<dt>Section 2</dt>

<dd>In order to be accredited as a Chartered Organization, an organization must abide by the following criteria:</dd>
</dl>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Be open to all members of the Brandeis community.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Not discriminate against members on the basis of race, color, ancestry, religious creed, gender identity and expression, national or ethnic origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, genetic information, disability, political affiliation and ideology, veteran status or any other category protected by law.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Not charge its members fees or dues or frequently engage in cost prohibitive activities without an attempt to offset costs through fundraising or allocated monies.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Not duplicate the purpose or goals of an existing UAO. If the prospective UAO’s operations,impact, and student appeal would substantively be the same as that of an existing UAO, then it should not be chartered. A group has duality of purpose if it has duality of operations, impact, and appeal. Collectively, this standard is called Duality of Purpose.</p>

<ol>
<li>Duality of Operations: If the new UAO would create similar activities and/or offer Brandeis students substantially similar experiences/opportunities to an existing UAO (example of duality: two martial arts groups that both focus on karate)</li>

<li>Duality of Impact: If the prospective UAO and an existing UAO would have substantially similar on-campus effects (example of duality: two groups that advocate for “greening” the campus). A UAO’s impact beyond Brandeis University, in and of itself, will not factor into determining duality of purpose but may be an indicator of differing student appeal.</li>

<li>Duality of Appeal: If the prospective UAO and an existing UAO would appeal to the same pool of prospective members (example of lack of duality: two political groups advocating opposite or different sides of the same issue or issues)</li>

<li>The National or International affiliation of an existing or the prospective UAO will have no bearing in determining duality of purpose between groups. All UAOs, whether or not they have non-Brandeis affiliations,will all be treated equally to one another regarding duality of purpose. Differing National or International affiliation in and of itself is not a substantial difference in terms of duality of purpose between groups.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>Not be a fraternity or sorority.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<dl>
<dt>Section 3</dt>
