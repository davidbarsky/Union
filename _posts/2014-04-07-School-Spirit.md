title: School Spirit Was On Full Display During Historic DEIS DAY Celebration
---

This year, the Student Union hosted the 2nd annual DEIS DAY, which we expanded remarkably from the inaugural event last year.  DEIS DAY was a day-long showcase of all of the sensational things that we do here on campus, and the incredible clubs, teams and organizations that we have here at Brandeis.  This year’s festivities included a school spirit parade through campus, where clubs designed their very own golf cart floats, a community barbecue, a Battle of the Band student music competition, and a featured comedian: Jay Pharoah, who is most widely known as Obama on Saturday Night Live.  The event, which coincided with Admitted Students Day this year, brought in hundreds upon hundreds of members of the Brandeis community, ranging from current students to prospective students to Alumni, and was a resounding success.
