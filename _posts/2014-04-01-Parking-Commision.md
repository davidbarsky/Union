title: Student Union-Sanctioned Committee on Parking Ready to Present Findings
---

One of the most pressing priorities of this year’s Student Union has been searching for a remedy for the various issues surrounding parking on the Brandeis campus.  In collaboration with the Graduate Student Association, we sent out a survey to the undergraduate and graduate student bodies in the fall.  The survey, which revolved around parking conditions on campus received 1500+ responses, demonstrating that this is an issue of enormous proportions for Brandeis students.  Following the survey, we in the Student Union assembled statistics from the Parking Office of the Department of Public Safety, and conducted research on parking conditions and policies at comparable universities.  We then sanctioned a task force of International Business School students, led by Jieming Chu, to conduct further research and cost analyses on potential short-term and long-term solutions to the parking issues on campus.  After working on this project for the entire year, we have created a comprehensive proposal for the administration which we will present towards the end of the month.
