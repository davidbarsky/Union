title: Deis Impact Was Taken to New Heights
---

Every year, the Student Union & Ethics Center co-sponsor Deis Impact, a weeklong festival of social justice.  This year, we received 50 club submissions for Deis Impact, ranging from an event where students sit inside a ball pit and compare differing perspectives on race, culture and diversity, to a social justice film festival where Brandeis students showcase their documentaries or short films about their passion for charities and other causes.  The Deis Impact keynote speakers this year were Kweku Mandela-Amuah and Ndaba Mandela, the grandchildren of Nelson Mandela and founders of the Africa Rising Foundation.
