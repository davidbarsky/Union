Constitutional Review Task Force Proposal Sent To Students For A Vote!
21 Senators signed onto the Constitutional Review Task Force’s proposal, which subsequently went out to students on Tuesday, April 8th.  The major changes that we made include: 

1. The establishment of a $250,000 Community Enhancement Fund through which students can submit projects to improve campus facilities; EX) new lights for Gosman field or smoking gazebos in residential quads.
2. The renaming of the Finance Board to the Allocations Board to reduce the level of student confusion about the Finance Board’s function.
3. The Allocations Board publishing allocations to the Senate and the student body following marathon periods.
4. The addition of a Senate representative onto the Allocations Board in place of the appointed member of A-Board.
5. Adding regular Intra-Union meetings coordinated by the President to increase collaboration between Union branches.
6. Reducing more than 50 percent of excess language in the Constitution.
