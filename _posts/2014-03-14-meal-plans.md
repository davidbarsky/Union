title: The Student Union Advocated for Changes to Dining Facilities & Meal Plans
---

We have been working closely with our new dining provider, Sodexo, through our Senate Dining Committee.  The Dining Committee and members of the Union Executive Board sent out multiple surveys to students on major dining issues such as meal plan structure and the future of “The Stein.”  Beyond this, we have been staunch advocates for including students in the process all year long.  Specific dining changes that we were a part of include the addition of a Dunkin Donuts & Starbucks onto campus, the launch of Louis’ Deli in Usdan and Peet’s Coffee in the Science Center, and the renovations to the Stein.
