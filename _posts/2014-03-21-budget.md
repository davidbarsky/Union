title: Budget Transparency Has Been At the Top of Our Agendas
---


The Union has been working hard for more transparency in our universityâ€™s budget all year long.  We worked with the school administration to issue a release of the executive compensation reports for senior administrative pay, which was publicly announced at the March 13th Faculty Senate Meeting.  We are continuing to advocate for more transparency in tuition dollar allocation through our Representatives to the Board of Trustees.
