---

The Student Union advocated for the creation of the Gender and Sexuality Coordinator position through a resolution which was put forward by Representative to the Board of Trustees Alex Thomson in the fall.  In response to this resolution, Brandeis recently announced that they will be establishing the Gender and Sexuality Coordinator position, as well as a Gender and Sexuality Center.
