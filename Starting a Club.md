So you're interested in starting a club?

Follow the steps below, and if you have any questions, email the club support chair, [Andrew Savage](mailto:ajsavage@brandeis.edu).

## Club Support Check List

1. Meet with the Club Support Committee. You can use the directory to talk to the right people.

2. Create a Club Constitution. We've attached an example copy.

3. Email a copy of your constitution to [Andrew Savage](mailto:ajsavage@brandeis.edu).

4. Get a hard copy of your constitution signed by a senator other than the club support chair.

5. Get signatures from 10 students for recognition and 135 for chartering. We've attached a template for you to use.

6. Let us know what you'll be doing for the next to two semesters. Make an outline — it doesn't have to be long!

7. Meet with 10 to 15 interested members of the club to discuss your organization. You should give us the attendance and agenda of the meeting.

8. All materials need to be turned in and completed before the Wednesday before the scheduled Senate meeting in order for the club to be voted on. The Club Support Committee will contact the club leader in order to confirm that their materials have been received and that they are on the agenda.
